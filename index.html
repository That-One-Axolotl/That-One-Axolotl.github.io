        <p>Hello, I'm That One Axolotl, a hobbyist programmer and freeskater, I also like gaming, my favorite is Hytale (aka the game that will never release).</p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is programming, though, I'm not very good at it, but I do like making random little python programs that are of no use to anyone, such as this amazing way to calculate pi, which picks a random number, checks if it matches that index in pi, and if so, adds it to the string, if not, it starts over, it would take my computer around 3*10^87 years to find just 100 digits, now thats what I call efficient! (please ignore the fact that I am setting the variable "true" to "False" just, just don't ask, its an inside joke, while were at it, just ignore all the bad code please)</p>
        <img src="https://that-one-axolotl.github.io/images/pythonpi.png" alt="my very bad python algorithm">
        <p>Sometimes however, I actually make some cooler projects, which you can see featured <a href="https://that-one-axolotl.github.io/pages/projects">here</a></p>
        <h2>Freeskating</h2>
        <p>I'm gonna have to explain what this is, because most people haven't seen or hear of this at all, so here's the basics, but you can learn more <a href="https://youtu.be/qApavYcTaRs?si=UmBLSmwIMPPjq1Yp" target="_blank">here</a></p>

        <p>So what are these things anyways? Well, think of a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and you get freeskates.</p>
