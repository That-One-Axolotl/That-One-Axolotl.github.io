        <p>Hello, I'm That One Axolotl, a hobbyist programmer and freeskater, I also like gaming, my favorite is Hytale (aka the game that will never release).</p>
        
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is programming, though, I'm not very good at it, but I do like making random little python programs that are of no use to anyone, such as this amazing way to calculate pi, which picks a random number, checks if it matches that index in pi, and if so, adds it to the string, if not, it starts over, it would take my computer around 3*10^87 years to find just 100 digits, now thats what I call efficient! (please ignore the fact that I am setting the variable "true" to "False" just, just don't ask, its an inside joke, while were at it, just ignore all the bad code please)</p>
        <img src="https://that-one-axolotl.github.io/images/pythonpi.png" alt="my very bad python algorithm">
        <p>Sometimes however, I actually make some cooler projects, which you can see featured <a href="https://that-one-axolotl.github.io/pages/projects">on my projects page</a></p>
        
        <h2>Freeskating</h2>
        <p>I'm gonna have to explain what this is, because most people haven't seen or heard of this at all, so here's the basics, but you can learn more <a href="https://youtu.be/qApavYcTaRs?si=UmBLSmwIMPPjq1Yp" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <img src="https://that-one-axolotl.github.io/images/freeskates.webp" alt="freeskates" width="500px">
        <p>So what are these things anyways? Well, think of a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and you get freeskates. They have a lot of trick potential, able to do things that nothing else I've seen can, there are even a lot of tricks you can do with two people. I'm not great at them, but I can do a few tricks, and I've been working on learing more lately.</p>
        <p>I highly reccomend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/aY5YDQ6AgBw?si=R6I5K41OfikhDNtX" target="_blank">this video.</a></p>
        
        <h2>Hytale</h2>
        <p>I first saw Hytale all the way back when the trailer first came out, which was a REALLY long time ago. After that, I kinda went on with my life with Hytale in the back of my mind, while I just waited for it's release. Over the years, it went through multiple delays, was sold to Riot games, and was eventually cancelled. I first started actively following it again after the Riot acquisition. The cancellation hit like a truck, and came out of no where, but we still have hope, Simon could still save it</p>
        
        <h2>#SaveHytale</h2>
        <p>I am gratfull to have been a part of the #SaveHytale movement, we did so much, even now, before Simon has (probably) saved it, it is increadible what we did, our biggest acheivement was Wplace, where we made 2 massive artworks, a giant Kweebec (one of the species in the game) in LA, and a huge artwork of Simon outside of Quebec, with all our signatures around it</p>
        <img src = "images/Wplace.png" alt="Wplace mural" width="1500px">
        <p>Eventually, our efforts were enough to get attention of Simon Hypixel himself (with some bullying from Tubbo), at the time of writing this, he is currently in active discussions with Riot Games about purchasing Hytale.</p>
