    <h2>Here are the rules:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Everyone in the world is playing The Game. (This is alternatively expressed as, "Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game" or "You are always playing The Game.") A person cannot refuse to play The Game; it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing.</li>
      <li>Whenever one thinks about The Game, one loses.</li>
      <li>Losses must be announced. This can be verbally, with a phrase such as "I just lost The Game", or in any other way: for example, via Facebook or other social media.</li>
    </ol>
